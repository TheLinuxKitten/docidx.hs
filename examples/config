-- Example configuration file for docidx.  

-- Lines beginning with "-- " (like this one) are comments and
-- ignored.  Empty lines are ignored as well, though lines containing
-- only whitespace will - like any other unrecognised line - cause a
-- warning to be issued.

-- The only actual config items currently recognised are "extra URLs"
-- for the table of contents - a list of links which appear after the
-- A-Z index links.  There are three kinds:
--
-- extra name url -- A hyperlink.  The name is separated from the url
--                   by whitespace.  The name can include whitespace.
--                   The url can not.
-- extraSeparator -- A separator character.
-- extraNewline   -- A newline character (well, <br /> in the HTML).

-- We start with a separator, between the (automatic) A-Z index links
-- and these extras.
extraSeparator

-- Always nice to have a quick route to the package index.

-- The rest of the hyperlinks in this example are personal to the
-- author and probably won't work for others without alteration.
